Coded in C for a micro controller of Freescale in a university project. 
The idea is to use the accelerometer sensor to play notes of a music and in the moment we make one mistake in the 
direction you should turn the device you lose points and the music cannot be heard anymore,
but it continue to play in the background with one inaudible frequency. 
The project was based in PWM for the frequencies played.
